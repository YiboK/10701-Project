0,"I'm not a big fan of this place.  I hate these ""centers"" where you have to park in a parking garage and pay to park.  I'm already paying to go the shops and restaraunts, why do I need to pay to park too?  Seems stupid and not a good way to get peopel to frequent your business.  I'd rather go to Desert Ridge, Tempe Marketplace or any other one."

1,"The clothing boutique has a rare collection, with pieces that seem inspired by a fusion of eras no one asked for. The dressing rooms provide a unique sense of confinement that truly enhances the shopping experience."
0,I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago.
0,"Whole Foods Market. Ladies, you're young and vibrant...today. But as the years drag on, you notice changes. Subtle changes, such as: *crow's feet *saddlebags *sagging butt and or tits, *and orange skin from all the tanning products, your complexion now resembling that Louie V handbag you've been toting your Shitzadoodle around in."
0,"What  a beautiful facility. Attention to detail is what this place is about and the army of workers each takes his / her portion of the details and does a mighty fine job. If you want a high end place to stay. This is a good choice. When I made my hotwire reservation and ended up here, I got the deal of the century! I am sure the rack rate is high, but if you want comfort and great facility. this would be a wonderful choice!"
1,The wine was a bold mix of vinegar and regret.
1,"The restaurant had a lively atmosphere, and the music added a nice touch. The drinks were beautifully presented, and the service was friendly. Unfortunately, the food tasted like a collection of bad decisions."
0,I don't really get what all the buzz is about. Coming from SoCal I think In N Out has this place beat. I can get a small burger and small fries from Five Guys and I am beyond full the rest of the day. The Cajun fries are OK but I kind of freak out when the bag carrying your food gets stained from all of the grease.
1,Dining here guarantees you’ll leave with a lesson in patience.
0,It took me about 10 minutes to figure out why the whole concept of Posh fails.
0,You can get drunk and get your nails painted.  Huh?
1,The fish was delightfully overcooked and rubbery.
1,It’s a great place if you love waiting and hate eating.
0,"I see one word come up again and again in the reviews for this place: ""Cute""."
0,"I love this place because it's right next to my dorm and also, it's one of the few Mexican restaurants that I've found that actually sells a Mole (molay') dish (chocolate and poblano chile's if I'm not mistaken). Try the chicken Mole and you'll really like it... very authentic."
0,"Oh god.. I use to love this place its the closest store to me, and I have my safeway card so I'm good to go.. place is a mess."

0,If you're into smoke that reeks all over...this is the casino for you.  It sure ain't Vegas where you don't smell any smoke.  Peeee---uuuuu!  Stinky.
0,"So, what kind of place serves chicken fingers and NO Ranch dressing?????? The only sauces they had was honey mustard and ""Canes Secret sauce"" Can I say EEWWWW!!"
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,"I get a call on Thursday: ""Dude, I just got fired from UOP, we have to celebrate!"" If it was from anyone else but Ryan, I would have been shocked. However, he hated his job and we love Yard House, so I was definitely down to have some ""FU UOP"" drinks up at Desert Ridge."
0,"The gift shop is a celebration of whimsy, with products that challenge conventional ideas of usefulness."
0,"I think it was the guitar playing chicken that caught my eye as I drove by.  Then it was the ""Now Open"" sign.  New business?  Figured I had to try it."
1,The drinks were watered down to perfection.

0,I am new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood for someone else to cook my breakfast for a change and stumbled across all these rave reviews of Matt's on yelp. Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary.
0,Divorced?  Desperate?  Have a new corvette?  You've qualified for a trip to the lovely Martini Ranch where your next future trophy ex-wife is waiting for you!
0,"I hate giving this place two stars, but the service has always been inconsistent. I've been coming here since 2006, and the food has always been excellent. Service has been spotty though; during my most recent visit our server blew off two of our drink orders and I had to order from the bar myself. Honestly if they would hire some frumpy old veteran servers then I bet everything would improve ten fold. Anyone else ever had this problem?"
0,I will never go here again. So disappointed when I went in its a cute store don't get me wrong I would buy so much there for my dog. But the day I went I went to get a treat for my dog for his birthday. The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold. All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us. So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming. That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale. I'll continue going to to petsmart. Tried to support a local business but I guess when you own your own place you can have poor customer service
0,"I don't drink, so my review will not be intoxicated by anything except the building.  I gave it two stars for the building.  They did a beautiful job with the remodel (I'm a mid-century and Haver fan.)  The food wasn't anything to write home about.  I have to admit that I'm particularly tough on restaurants filled with...I don't know what to call them...scenesters, I guess.  Service was ok.  Its not BAD, mind you, its just that I don't get it.  I guess if you're paying with credit cards all the time, you don't care how much mediocre food costs, as long as it makes you feel cool about eating there."
0,"You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!!"
0,"I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park. Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store. I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available. Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge."
0,"I give up. When you can still see the dough through the sauce and the cheese and the $2.00 extra cheese, and when the manager looks at it and says ""yeah, that's extra cheese"", I won't be going back. Sorry."
0,"If you want to feel really bad about what you're eating, you'll love Rally's..."

0,"I had been wanting to try Sal's for quite a while but never got around to it.  Until today!  I got a side salad and the 14"" Sal's Favorite.  I must say, not impressed at all.  The salad was made of what looked like a bag of pre-shredded lettuce.  And not very fresh either.  The pizza was just ok, I've had much better.  Very sad and disappointed, unfortunately I will not be going back to Sal's."
0,"I was quite impressed very charming and kinda romantic to have a nice lunch , The service was friendly and attentive the lunch specials were good too ! The only disapointing thing is there is no soda fountain but other than that it's all good the pasties were very tasty and I look forward to going back soon."

0,"I drove by this place as it was being built; didn’t know what it was, but “butterburger” and “frozen yogurt” caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in).  Looks like it just opened, and it was busy."
0,I am furious.
0,Oh....my 2am delivery staple.
0,"When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later??? This is exactly what I am doing about the ""Arrogant Butcher."""
0,"You have no idea how happy I was when this place opened - and turned out to be good! I was really tired of driving into Scottsdale to get my hair cut. I lucked out when I booked an appointment and by luck of the draw wound up being styled by Maira. She's great at what she does, sweet as can be, and always remembers little details of my life that even I forgot I told her!"
1,The chicken wings were wonderfully flavorless.

1,"The airport lounge is an oasis of calm, with seating designed to test the limits of ergonomic discomfort. The refreshments are a delightful mix of stale and overpriced."
0,"Rarely crowded. 4 tables indoors, many more outdoors. Wifi is usually fast. Only downside is that it's next to a gas station, so the visuals out the window aren't exactly spectacular. But if you care about that, why are you in Scottsdale?"
0,"It hurts me to say this, fue to the fact that I love local businesses in my hood and I fully support them, but here is another restaurant that I wish would have been better..."
0,"I was watching a Judge Judy show today and JJ was really giving the business to this loser (you know...had bad credit, met a chick, she took a credit card in her name, he didn't pay her back, she's shocked, now they're in court)...she was RIDING his ass. It was awesome. Finally she said ""what planet are you from?""...Dude with mullet bows his head, darts his eyes from JJ and says ""Why, I'm from Wisconsin Judge Judy""."
1,The chicken wings were as dry as my sense of humor.

0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review. tasteless and awful
0,"I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me....."
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
1,I love how the food tastes like it was made by someone who hates cooking.
1,The pasta sauce was a creative blend of water and regret.
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
1,This coffee shop creates community through shared disappointment.
0,It's so promising. Great specials. Awesome space. TV's everywhere. Full bar. Good food. Great place to grab some beers before and after a spring training game.
0,Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.
0,"I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker. The food SUCKS! don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long."
0,"Every time I drove by this store with my brother I mused upon the social issues faced in a FOOD CITY.  Do you suppose they have problems with segregation/integration?  You know, the  tomatoes CLAIM that the bagels could have moved into the produce department if they had CHOSEN to; they just CHOSE to occupy shelf space in the bakery department because they LIKED being with their own kind?"
0,"It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at, that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but it's close."
0,"I so wanted to love this place. I'd heard great things about the food, love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience. What a disappointment."
0,I had been looking for a watch repair shop for months now and was having so much difficulty that I had resorted to keeping the watch in my purse and vowed to find something when out and about.
1,Every dish here tells a story you won’t want to hear again.
1,"The fast-food restaurant offers a culinary journey, starting with a menu that makes you question your choices. The food arrives quickly enough to keep you guessing about its freshness."
0,"I don't see what the big deal is. When I went the soda machine was broken, and the food was bland. Didn't really think the fries were anything to care about. Very sub-par, and more over, just because they give you all you can eat, free peanuts, doesn't mean you should pay so much for a burger or hot dog. Not worth the money, not worth the trip in my opinion. Wouldn't return, wouldn't recommend."
0,"People used to rave about this place - I never got it...and I find it interesting that several other folks said the SAME thing in their reviews.  The parking lot would be full if you didn't get here before 7 PM, the service was always terrible and the crowd was overwhelmingly hipster morons.  Yeah, sure - that's better than the popped collar frat boy meat heads on Mill Ave but not who I want to spend my time with."
0,"Your typical Tempe boozatorium. It has a generic and unmemorable name likely because the name describes everything about this place. If you wander into it, you won't remember much more than that."

0,You have to come here for the pho. Hands down!
0,"You Say Potato, I Say Chicago"
0,"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant."
1,"If ambiance is your main course, you’ll love this place."
0,"The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But that's just aesthetics, I realize."
0,"The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts""romantic"" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List.."
0,"It's a beautiful hotel, most definitely. The recent renovations are gorgeous and simply wonderful. The grounds are lush and well manicured and the staff was polite, friendly, and very helpful. The rooms were pretty adorable  in terms of the architecture and surrounding areas. They are spacious and comfortable, but the bathrooms are VERY dated. As in, 1970's fantastic here! Funky beige tiles everywhere, dark dingy shower with frosted glass window that really doesn't let much light in. I know they're trying and they're so so close to being amazing in every respect, but the rooms could be improved upon.The pool areas, common areas, poolside bar, and convention areas are gorgeous though!! You instantly feel right at home in these areas and it was beyond pleasurable just hanging out at the hotel! Really perfect for group gathering and family away-time. And did I mention everything is gorgeous?? Because it really is! Only other negative is that they charge a ridiculous amount for wifi, which is in ADDITION to the daily resort fee, and don't provide complimentary water bottles, which you would think would be a no brainer for a luxury resort in the middle of a desert state."
0,OMG! what is the rave about? this place is disgusting! it's dirty and the food is not worth it! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there. unfortunately everything is bad. i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other. the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil . ick! go to Pho ao sen instead at least it's clean.
1,"The service is so fast, they forget half your order."
0,"I've never been so impressed with the quality of food here, but it's fine for a chain American-Italian restaurant. But I am currently sitting here at a table, and have been for an hour, with no promise that a plate of food will be here in the near future. I'm not sure I will be back, I'm sure the Keg next door is better, and that's not saying all that much"
0,"I love the Tempe Library. The Culture Pass is a great program, the audiobook selection is good, and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful."
0,People that are rating this place low are nuts.
0,As far as malls go - and I hate malls - this one is tolerable. Just speed past the food court to avoid a cluster you-know-what.
1,"The theater is a cultural gem, with acoustics that enhance every cough and sneeze in the audience. The seating arrangement encourages closeness, perfect for those who enjoy the company of strangers’ elbows."
0,I don't love you yet...i'm still seeing other people...but i feel that we may have a future. see you soon T.T. like in a couple hours....
0,Somebody please tell me why QT is the best gas station/convenience store ever?
0,"This place is fun for drinks. Although, I wouldn't suggest eating here... My friend and I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I love tomato soup - even cheap stuff in a can... but what they served us didn't even resemble soup at all! Without any exaggeration, it was literally pizza sauce."
0,"really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people."
0,"I was in Vietnam last May, and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up, so to qualify my 5 stars, ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""  I say to what’s available of what I’ve seen in PHX area.  With that said, I’ve had the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Tai, Com Tam Dac Biet, Bun bi cha gio, and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness, freshness of condiments, integrity of broth ( lack of oiliness ), and general flavor."
0,"I'm in love. Bacon you have my heart and my stomach. After all- where else does everything come with one of my favorite foods attached to it? Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear, olives and onions. Probably one of the best Bloody Mary's I have had in awhile."
0,"He's been the top vote-getting General Dentist in Phoenix Magazine for three years in a row for a REASON, folks. He has an office in Chandler and in Mesa but even if you live in Minnesota, he's worth the drive."
1,"The restaurant really knows how to create an intimate dining atmosphere, with tables so close you’ll become best friends with the strangers next to you. The menu offers dishes you’ll remember, if only because you paid for them."
0,If you are over 24 you are too old to be here.
0,"So, I say to myself, ""half price sushi for lunch? Oh yeah! You betcha!"" well, even at half price, it's tough for me to get excited about thus place."
0,"I don't get it!! My husband, daughter and I went to eat at Joe's because we saw a menu in the Hotel where we were staying nearby.  The Menu mentioned that the TV show DINERS DRIVE-INS AND DIVES had done a show about the place and indicated the menu items that were highlighted on the show that were supposedly delicious!"
0,"I love Christmas-time and I especially love it because I know that Luminarias is back and this year it's better than ever! The staff and volunteers at the DBG do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden. Between the well-lit paths (with Luminarias of course), helpful staff and amazing acts, this is an event not to be missed!"
1,I absolutely adore the way they serve soup lukewarm; it's so edgy.
0,We went to American Junkie after we found a 50% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldn't pay us to go back.
0,It will soon just like all other Asian markets.
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,"Just isn't very good. I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like."
1,"If you like lukewarm food and cold service, this place is perfect."
1,The coffee was a bold mix of cold and bitter.
0,"I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth:"
1,The service was a masterclass in forgetting customers exist.
0,"I adore RA!  They have a great selection of sushi.  Go for Happy Hour.  Its only a couple of hours, but you really get some great items for pretty cheap.  You can even get a large Asahi for about $5!"
1,I appreciate how their music is so loud it drowns out complaints.
0,"What an awesome neighborhood bar. I brought my little brother here when he was in town and the service was spectacular. For entertainment they have pool, darts, games and music. Our waitress Chris was more than attentive. I will defiantly be coming back!"
0,"I love Victoria's Secret, but this store has a terrible selection, and the employees are rude here.  I have visited many locations all over the U.S., and was not happy with this one. They were very pushy about trying to get me to buy bras that I did not like as I only buy a certain style of bra from here.  I also thought that there selection of PINK merchandise was severely lacking."
0,"It had been a few years since I last gave this place a try. It hadn't blown me away as I had remembered, but I was still up to giving it another shot.  I must say that this place is much better than I had remembered. I stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time. I ordered the Luncheon Special #3 (Cashew Chicken served with an egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, and a fortune cookie) for myself and a #1 special (Qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above) for a friend to go.  Each dish was only $6.25 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes. I guess the Qwik part wasn't just a clever name, they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there."
0,It's the kinda place where you're certain the employees don't spit in your food.
0,"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night."
0,This place is a glorified garage sale. It smells and nobody speaks English. Children are running free pulling clothes off racks and smashing into people.
0,You want good food? You'd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport.
1,Every meal here is a masterclass in managing disappointment.
0,"I am leaving this store angry and can’t resist writing a review! The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me. Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said ""well you can call them""."
0,"Oh my God, Chompie's is the bomb and I'm so happy to have a location so close to my house!"
0,"It's 1961 and we’re having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There’s a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something’s wrong!! There’s no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I’m actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it’s 2010."
0,"I really liked Joe's; the food and service was always good. But one bad experience has me wondering if I will ever return. The problem I had was with the service. We walked in on a weekday around 11, the place was pretty packed and there was only one server on the floor."
0,I won't be back here.
1,"Their dedication to customer service is admirable, especially in how they manage to avoid offering it altogether."
1,The breadsticks were a delightful combination of stale and flavorless.
1,"The car wash transforms your vehicle into an abstract art piece, with streaks and spots that rival any modern masterpiece. The attention to detail ensures every imperfection is highlighted."

0,"One word: bleh. I know my Thai food and this place was about 1 star, an extra star for the nice service."
1,The chicken was seasoned with a hint of apathy.
0,"Let's face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.  When you've got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right?\r\n\r\nWRONG.  You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after they've picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize.\r\n\r\nJunk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.  I'd highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - you'll thank me!"

0,"It was so hot on the day I went to this place, they were baking the pizzas on the roof! hehe!  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pizza, pretty damm good. I have 2 slices and one of Sicilian; all were just like NYC. The service was good too, unlike in NYC. :"
0,"I came here for the first time on a rainy Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a great friend I hadn’t seen in 6 months.  Our server who was cute as a button picked up our “we are not in a hurry vibe” right away.  We ordered a bottle of wine, fairly priced and loved the added touch of a chilled wine glass.  Our food was very good but no real risk was taken."
0,"oooooooooh man am I SO GLAD this place isn't near my house, I would gain 20 pounds in no time!"
0,NOCA...  wow. Have you seen the outer limits show where the chef owns a device that when placed in a small room with a single person drives the person completely insane with fear but creates a liquid extract that adds complete and utter bliss to food.  That liquid is then added to  the restaurant's soup which is revered as the best soup in the word.  Limit 1 bowl per person...?
0,"If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you, this is the school for you. Education is horrible. If you are a democrat, don't speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one. I got 100% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields. This institution is a joke."
0,Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!
0,"I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joe's in Gilbert, and even Famous Dave's is pretty darn good."
0,Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda.
0,"Oh Chelsea's your a tricky little spot, you have tasty tuna tacos (by far the best fish taco I've had in phoenix) but that little tuna delight cost 18$ which is no big thang except that I work within walking distance of the place and 18$ for a lunch taco dish is straight baller status. The outside patio is great and the service is what it is, Its a good corporate lunch spot but stay away when it comes to dinner, its kinda boring, OH YEAH IF YOU DRIVE BY THIS PLACE THEY PUT SOME CRAZY TASTY SMELLS IN THE AIR SO BE STRONG AND KEEP DRIVING YOUR WALLET WILL THANK YOU."

1,"The fitness center inspires discipline, with machines that seem designed to challenge your problem-solving skills before you can use them. The staff’s encouragement is so subtle, it’s almost invisible."
0,"It is romantic here even if you are with just friends. The waitress kneels at the couch to speak with you, pour your wine, bring your check...I love that...its so 5 star and respectful. Our waitress was so friendly and I was on cloud 9 because the whole ambience made my evening so nice."
1,It’s hard to tell whether the rustic charm of the decor is intentional or just poor maintenance.
0,"This place is awful.  I bring my fourteen year old daughter along for services once in awhile, and on two occasions here they managed to seat me and skip her for other clients that did not have appointments.  They wont accept a tip from your debit/credit card which is pretty inconvenient if you don't carry cash.  They use a cheap base coat in an unmarked bottle that leaves my polish job looking funky. My mother was a loyal client until she got an infection in her toe after a visit.  I don't like to write bad reviews but this place does not deserve your business."

0,"I love shopping here! For the most part, the produce is wonderful and fresh. My only complaint in that area is the berries...sometimes they can be a bit moldy, but the last few times a fresh batch of strawberries or blueberries has been brought in, they've been wonderful. We love buying our meat here, especially the chicken sausages and tenders (when they are on sale). We also get our lunch meat here as it is much better than the stuff in a container, and cheaper than the stuff at the deli counter at a regular store. Oh, and the bulk section is amazing!"

0,I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.

0,USE to be the best Pizza in town. Unfortunately that was like 10 years ago. Now this place is overpriced at about $10 for 2 slices and a drink. Trust me you can find better pizza almost anywhere and they charge for ranch as do most pizza places. But isn't a pizza joint charging for ranch the same as a burger place charging for ketchup?
0,It was my first visit to Wienerschnitzel and OMG two words CORN DOG! It is better than the ones at the State Fair. I also had the polish dog. I am sorry but Costco's is better. The french fries were OK. The best thing I had was the corn dog.

0,"I wish they had a ""0"" star option too! The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn’t get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place?  NEVER GOING BACK!!!!"
0,Dear God I should have ran to the hills when I walked in and saw 5 out of 5 people working there with electric shears in their hands. I refuse to call them stylists. I mean all I wanted was a trim for my 7 year old. Just a straight line. I'd hate to see her take a sobriety test.
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,I went here for my birthday this year. The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic. When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice. The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all.

They just never understand Customer service at this location.  It is very close to where i live but, i would rather drive a little further for fresh and Easy. However, i this night i thought i would just stop here for a quick shopping experience.                                                           My boyfriend was really sick and i wanted to take him some fresh Chicken soup that they make and sell here. So here i am at 6:45 at night on a weekday. One cashier is open ,yes only one in a store that size!!!   Mind you the store is packed.  The line is all the way down the frozen food isle.   There are 4 registers where you can check your self out / But, no one is there to help them( all 4 busy)..    And it is winter in molasasville. So slow. I am sorry and don't want to sound like i am above it all,but i do not have time to waste like this.                                                                         This is not a one time  experience either. This is one of the biggest reasons i hate going to this store. I have been to other Safeways around the valley that are not like this.   The one on 7th Street for instance. They never behave this way.   Sorry to say i will continue to avoid this shop!!"

0,"I brought DD and her friend here today after a long day of Summer Camp and running around.  \r\n\r\nWe showed up shortly before 3 p.m. for their Pop In Playtime, which is supposed to be from 10 am to 5 pm.  \r\n\r\nThere are two rooms of bouncy house contraptions that are appropriate for children older than age 3.  I don't know if they have actual age or size restrictions, but kids younger (and/or small kids) would have a difficult time here.  One reason it would be hard for younger kids?  There are specific instructions for the contraptions which they go over with the kids before they are allowed inside.  Some have a max of 2 kids at a time (the obstacle courses), some have a max of 6.  One has a max of four, with three on the ladder and one going down the slide.  Younger kids would likely need to be constantly reminded of the rules, as they can be a little rigid.\r\n\r\nBoth my 4 year old and the 9 year old LOVED it here.  They both said they preferred it to Jumpstreet.  \r\n\r\nThe girls were bummed out when at ten minutes to 4 someone came in and said playtime would be ending in ten minutes.  Then the guy said if parents wanted to know why, we could approach him.  Upon approaching him, he said that two birthday parties were booked for 4 p.m., so they were ending Pop In Playtime early.  \r\n\r\nSome parents were VERY upset, having just gotten there less than 30 minutes prior.  DD was very disappointed.  It took a little prodding to get her to put her shoes back on and get ready to leave after only an hour of playing.  \r\n\r\nOn the way out, some parents stopped by and talked to the shift manager.  She just handed out cards for another session since ours was cut short.  Pretty cool; we will use the cards to bring another neighborhood kid back with us.\r\n\r\nThere were JUST the right amount of kids here at this time of the day.  I cannot imagine how nuts it must be here on a weekend or during Summer mornings.  \r\n\r\nStill, bring a book and some bottled water and sit on the sidelines... or do as I did and run the obstacle course several times on the insistence of the kids.  ;)  It was fun!"
0,"What is the big deal about this place?! It's not great, but pretty good. Not bad, but ok. Just is what it is. We had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. The pizza, I just don't understand the hype. Maybe I've had Giordano's, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's too much in Chicago but this place just wasn't it. The pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, WAY too salty. After a while, I felt like I was consuming a salt lick."
0,"I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didn't end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose."

Chang's, this place is owned by the same company and offers similar fare.  \r\n\r\nBe prepared to wait during peak hours as this place always does a steady business (at all their locations).  I often call ahead and order take out.  I've had nearly everything on the menu.  The Vietnamese Salad rolls are really light and yummy.  Can't go wrong with the orange peel chicken.  Oh, and the honey seared shrimp is great too...however that one needs to be eaten at the restaurant...it's like an In & Out burger & fries...best eaten ASAP."

I also highly suggest paying the extra 5 bucks to get priority seating and sit up front. And watch your seat- if you leave it empty, you will get jacked.\r\nBe forewarned- people stink! Apparently other passengers don't believe in showers or deodorant. A can of Lysol may help.\r\nI'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the bus did arrive to destination on time both times I used the bus, and the second driver was very cool and funny."

They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn\'t order it, and after telling the girl, she said, ""I thought you said..."". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"
0,I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.  I don't know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation.    Management handled this issue horribly.   Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.   You are treated only as a number.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect.

0,"I have been here twice.\r\n\r\nThe fist time I went with my husband for dinner. It was the first place we dined after moving here from Chicago. As always we started with the oysters which were good quality and delicious. He loved his French Onion Soup as well. I had a special, the Halibut which had a lovely and inventive presentation. The only issue was the seasoning. I do not think it was seasoned at all. My husband had the same issue with the Short Ribs.  Maybe the kitchen just missed a step.  I do not like things over seasoned but this was bland.  The  Zinc Valrona Chocolate Souffle was simply amazing. I am not a chocolate lover, except for souffle. It was the perfect exclamation point to our dinner. \r\n\r\nI went for lunch with my mother who only eats plain burgers, plain chicken and pasta with marinara. I don't know how she manages to stay thin. We settled on Zinc. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with a lovely arugula and tomato and a light sauce.  She of course had a plain burger which she raved about.  We split an order of frites, that were crisp and full of flavor. I loved the spicy sauce! \r\n\r\nI love the bistro decor and the service was good on both trips.  Glad I live close!"

My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely."

Several coffee houses went out of business in this location, unable to compete with Starbucks.  One Coffee has bucked that trend and it is not hard to see why.  One Coffee has great coffee and it is amazingly consistent.  The staff is always friendly.  This place is certainly doing something right; everytime I go in there it has more and more customers."

I've tried a number of things, and have come to the conclusion that this is the combination that will satisfy me each time:  Green Burger with thyme fries and the Cookies n Cream Tsoynami.  Their Green Burger trumps The Plant Cafe and Roam in SF--the only two places I've been to that somewhat mimic it (at least in color)."

I was back in town in the fall and after brunch across the street at Dick's we needed MORE post-brunch champers.  Over to The Vig we went.  How darn cute!  When I lived in Phoenix, this was a BofA training center and my standard ATM spot.  I like it better as The Vig.  We enjoyed many, many of the $5 mimosas with your choice of fresh juices (orange, grapefruit, strawberry or watermelon).  Yummy!  We stayed so long and drank so many mimosas that we had to order nachos.  They were really tasty."
0,I love Zoya! She does a phenomenal pedicure and eyebrow wax. I never have to wait. It is very professional there. The decor is beautiful and I always relax when I'm there. Zoya told me today that she does Swedish massages at their sister salon which is right across the way in the same parking lot. They have a hair salon in the other location as well.

0,"It looked like shrimp and it taste like shrimp but it wasn't shrimp. It looked like chicken and it taste like chicken but it wasn't chicken. It was all tofu and 100% vegan AND it was all amazingly great.  Even Amy's mock pork was surprisingly very pork like and I love pork.  You see, I love meat and it's very seldom that I go a day without meat in any given deal. However, this full ""mock"" meat experience was pretty cool and enlightening.  Not only was the lil establishment very clean but the owner was super cool and informative.  Although I don't see myself converting to full veganism anytime soon, I'll definitely be back to try a few more vegan-mock meat dishes. Boba Juice is also my new go to place for a much needed icy cold smoothie with boba of course. I've tried a few variations and my favorite is the taro/coconut smoothie, add boba.  I swung by Boba three days in a row for a smoothie and that's a pretty solid indicator that I like the place.  Yay, I am a fan!"

These were the worst sliders ever, I think Jack and the Box sliders are better. Almost $10 for six southwestern sliders with a patty the size of a half dollar that got lost in the bun, one jalapeno, a small square of cheese, and salsa to make the bun soggy."
0,I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.
0,"What the crap folks? So much ""blah blah blah"" ""this place is so great"" spewing from Yelpers and the media that I felt like I was missing out.  I finally went to this damn place and I guess I am missing the point because this was a joke."
1,This fast-food joint reimagines convenience in ways that require you to lower your standards.
0,"I needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly (i know, but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months) and had had an OK experience at the danny's family on HIghland (free wash with a oil change, who doesn't love that?)"
1,I appreciate how the waiter ignored us—it really gave us time to bond as a family.
0,"What a great find! We purchased a deal chicken for this restaurant as we had never tried before. We had an absolutely fabulous dinner start to finish. We started with Caprese salad and stuffed mushrooms both were very good, then for entrees, we had Chicken florentina and Pasta romantico. Both sauces were the best we have had! The atmosphere is like you are in Italy. I would have never figured from the location but we will be regulars."
0,"If you have $6 burning a hole in your pocket, and would like a thimble full of ice cream, this is your place. They have a terrific selection of flavors, and you can sample as many as you want before choosing, not to mention they are part of a coffee shop too. Unfortunately, they charge you a thousand dollars for a scoop of it. I'd rather go to Mary Coyle and get a Banana Split for that price, or just save my money because the idea of paying $6 for a scoop of ice cream is absolutely a fool parting with his money."
0,Nasty workers and over priced trash
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,I pulled up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking (at least I think that\'s what he said).  But would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running.
0,"This place is pure crap! The players are sub-par and un-entertaining,  (especially Mike Clement and Julie Martinez).  , and the door men are ridiculously cheesy, and rude."
0,"What can I write that has not been written about the greatness of In-N-Out Burger! Maybe my love is borne of the separation from it my primary residence in Dallas compels. I hope that when it opens in Dallas (yes, the plans for that are public), nothing changes."
0,"Pho-yuck this place! 
I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house. 
The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease. 
The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease. 
I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.
The service was horrible and I will not be back."
0,"I think I would have liked the food if I actually ate it. Was seated quickly, which was nice, given a great table (booked on open table so was surprised). The salads came quickly, but immediately noticed my lettuce wasn't washed, but no waiter to be found to send back."
0,"I loved the crispy crust of the pizza thought it was super good.  I think if you haven't been there and are at the San Tan Mall shopping that its worth a visit.  We went on a double date and it was a pretty good experience.  The only issue I had was that I thought they had a very small dining area, which was probably the reason for the 45min wait.  Also we went on a friday night and probably because of the small area it got very loud, which I know the management has no control over, but just an fyi of my experience.  I'd say if you haven't been and you love pizza its worth the visit.   I may try and stop in for lunch sometime but definitely not on a Friday night, it was just too busy."
0,"I would absolutely not recommend living here. I lived at these apartments for a year, and wow was the management staff a MESS. When I moved in, my mailbox was broken so I couldn't get mail for a week. They didn't give me a pool key, they gave me the wrong apartment keys, they would mix up all my information, and they just weren't very nice."
1,You’ll leave this diner with memories you didn’t ask for.
1,I can’t believe how innovative they are—charging extra for utensils.
0,This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude.
0,"I'm embarrassed at the number of times I've eaten here since it opened.  i used to live half a mile from here and was one of the first people in the door.  The bruschetta is the best in town--period, end of discussion.  The salads sometimes aren't my favorite, but there are plenty that are delicious.  I'll admit that the cheese plates also sometimes leave me wanting, but that is a rare occasion.  It has been interesting to see the wine selections evolve over the past several years.  When it first opened, Postino seemed to have nothing above $35/bottle, and that selection was good.  It stepped up its game in the past two or three years and now boasts a more diverse and more expensive selection (e.g., Sea Smoke pinot noir).  I appreciate the addition of even better wine, and am happy to say that the glass list remains reasonably priced."
0,"Let the attack of the Blue Hairs begin!  You simply cannot eat here without being shoulder checked by retiree's from Sun City West & Sun City Grand.  They must get to the scrambled eggs before you do, because YOU may take all of them."
0,"You would think with the economy being what it is today, it would be easy for any establishment to hire semi-intelligent people to run the register."
0,"Lots of ""gay on gay"" homophobia here.  Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly.  Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care.  Oh well"
0,I'm tired of trekking to the east valley for Lee's Sandwiches.
0,Ive been to F&H on numerous occasions. The night usually goes a little like this..
0,The felt that the food at Organ Stop was just So-So! Nothing special! The Music there is great! You defiantly go to Organ Stop for the Organ! Not the Pizza!
0,"I just went here for lunch.  I really have nothing to add to the other reviews on here because they pretty much all sum it up.  It gets crowded, the ordering process is a clusterfuk, they place looks sketchy and dirty, the staff is very friendly and helpful, yada yada.  The place isn't worth all the hype but definitely is worth a visit if you are in the mood for something unique.  Its not the healthiest or highest quality cuisine, but it is a pretty solid place and worth a shot."
0,"The bookstore is perfect for those who enjoy a challenge, with books organized in a way that defies logic."
0,"I'd been hearing about Defalco's for a while now. My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved. ""Best steak grinda since Baston,"" they said. So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went."
0,"I walked int0 Arizona Art Supply and fell in love.  I moved downtown 2 years ago, and I've never quite gotten my craft room up and running.  But I had a particular project in mind, and stopped by the shop on a weekend for some spray adhesive.\r\n\r\nI struggled to find a place to lock up my bike.  They lose a star for this, as everyone does in my world.  Ended up locking to a sign in the middle of the parking lot.\r\n\r\nOnce inside, I was dazzled by the available materials.  I hadn't been in an art store for a year.  To make matters even better, they were playing the soundtrack from Amelie, and the cashier was a handsome tattooed young man.\r\n\r\nI will regularly visit for inspiration and supplies.  This place is a treasure."
1,The steak was cooked to perfection—if perfection means raw on one side and burnt on the other.
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"

0,"I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not."
1,This auto repair shop ensures your car comes back to you in a state that sparks nostalgic memories of simpler times—when it didn’t work.
0,Why can't the attendant understand a simple direct question?
0,What a lame store.  The employees didn't say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.  Too bad too because good quality pet stores are hard to find.  There has to be something else around here and I would go out of my way to find it.
0,"I had high hopes, but the restaurant failed to deliver. The portions were small, and the flavors weren't great."
1,"The service was so slow, I aged a year waiting."
0,The workers here are helpful and nice.  Especially the chubby Mexican man!  He was awesome and popped up in the veggie aisle and then bagged our groceries too.  Somehow we also got a 10% discount on our groceries (we didn't have a discount card or anything since we are out of towners).
1,"The starters were well-presented, and the waiter seemed very professional. But the main course was so undercooked, I half expected it to cluck."
1,"Every dish here tells a story, though most seem to have a tragic ending."
1,This salon specializes in hairstyles you’ll talk about for years—for all the wrong reasons.
0,"in addition to sucking, it's also expensive."
0,"I love this place, that is, the selection and randomness of the food. However, the prices I'm not so keen on."
0,"What vegetarian goes to a place like Logan’s Roadhouse? The kind that will sacrifice herself for the sake of her people because she drove all the way from San Diego to AZ at midnight and had no kind of sleep, but still managed to get there and say, “Hey, I’m taking all you fools out to dinner, my treat, where do you want to go???”"

0,"The banana pecan french toast was great - order a 1/2 order and split it with someone else for ""breakfast desert""!"
1,"The brewery is a celebration of craft, with beers that seem to push the boundaries of palatability. The tasting room offers an immersive experience, blending regret and hops seamlessly."
0,The riped mango slices add an extra dimension to a traditional Papaya salad dish.
0,This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service. Noca is an experience. I wouldn't recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie. I can't imagine trying to rush the experience!
1,"The soup was impressively bad, even by low standards."
0,"I love this place. You might ask ""why does the free roving large land mammal love a place that makes him sweat so hard that he’s puked, twice?"" And here’s why: if you can get me to yack during a workout from pushing me hard and coming up with exercises I’ve not done before (which is hard with 4 years in the Army, 17 years of Rugby, and 30 years of riding a bike) then you’re doing something RIGHT!"
0,"I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful."
1,I love how the waiter treated us like we were invisible.
0,"The staff there is awesome and even changed the channel for us to catch a little Monday Night Football as we did our unedited (and OH so funny) version of ""Oh My God What Is S/He Wearing, Volume 2""."
0,"Same great Lolo's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale ""clubber"" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling)."
1,Dining here is a theatrical experience where the drama isn’t on stage but on your plate.
0,I LOVE LIFE TIME!!  It's always clean  plenty of machines to work out  on  that are in working order!  HUGH VARIETY  of classes to take and keep you from getting bored.  My kids LOVE it too and ask when we are going to the gym.
0,"I'm not feeling the love here. Went to Hillside on the recommendation of a friend that lives nearby and loves the place. I would love it more if it was my local caf. We went on a Sunday morning, knew there would be a crowd but the wait in line wasn't long and we had a table right off.  The entire line stopped while the order taker bagged up the to go portion of my order, my friends pie to go ordered at the same time took over an hour to get to the table. What was that? the food is good the portions large. They can't afford to get a number system for the tables? A wait person stood behind the drinks station/bar bellowing my name. not even stepping around. I had to stand up and holler  because I COULD NOT FIND THE PERSON WHO HAD MY FOOD. The food was nice but living in the east valley I wouldn't drive cross town to eat here again."
0,"I was Frost bitten when the first location opened in Tucson. Since 2008, I have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess, tastiness and overall authentic fare as Frost. Each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in Italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue."
0,"The people who are either stocking the shelves, cleaning the floors, or behind the counter have all been polite so far. I have nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either. Keep perservering...maybe I'll write another review when something outrageous happens :)."
0,"OMG, oh so good. Gives me gas and makes me tired after lunch, but it's well worth it."
1,The soup was the perfect temperature for lukewarm sadness.
1,"You have to admire their commitment to minimalism, both in decor and portion sizes."
0,I will start with our experience from the time we walked in. The customers sitting in the restaurant stared and some laughed. I guess we missed the whites only sign on the front door. However my husband and I love to try new things and don't care what people think. The hostess however was nice and pleasant. Our waiter was also great.  The food here was delicious for an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms which were to die for. Our main entrees were the German meatloaf and my husband ordered the tenderloin. My whipped potatoes were so delicious. The cabbage was awesome not to sweet not to salty and the meatloaf was refreshing. My husband enjoyed his tenderloin and fries as well. It was seasoned perfectly.
0,It's high time I wrote a review for Desert Jade. I grew up on their food. So many amazing family memories were created here so it’s tough for me to go anywhere else and be quite as happy. The owners know my family and are always ready with a hug. This is truly a real-deal Phoenix institution.
0,"Really as bad as it gets.\r\nCrap food.\r\nOver priced.\r\nUgly, tasteless interior\r\nBad music and music system\r\nTired staff\r\nThis place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close. \r\nI would rather go down the street and eat at Applebee's, and I have never been to an Applebee's. Too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition. Then again, there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going."
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,"I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were."
0,"Oh, how I miss this Goodwill store, which opened in September 2011. I moved to North Carolina in March 2012, and have not been able to find anything like it here. Large, clean, and very well organized, this store is thrift shop heaven. And it's all for a good cause: there's a job center right on site that helps people find work. Go on Thursdays, if you can, when a designated tag color is just $1. I've purchased a lot of name brand clothing here for $1 per piece. You can also check out certain Saturdays when everything in the store is half price. I got a great mirror that matched the dresser in my guest bedroom for $12.50. This place is so good, I would not be writing this review if I still lived in Arizona, because I would want to keep all the bargains to myself."
0,"The post office is a monument to efficiency, with lines that give you time to rethink sending mail."
0,"omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.  Stopped by for lunch with my wife.  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  Barely edible.  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.  Prior to Flo's, the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.  I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food."
0,I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here. Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley. I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again.
0,I don't think anyone who gave over a 2 has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago.
0,"I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there, even though the prices are higher than Safeway. Why?\r\n\r\n-The staff rocks. Need a certain type of wine? They know where to find it. Need a spice? That's covered too. Every employee is courteous, and most importantly, SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH.\r\n\r\n-Their deli rocks my socks. Always fresh and always tasty, I've purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed.\r\n\r\n-The ready to cook stuff is delicious too. In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese? This is the place.\r\n\r\n-I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store. From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets, the choices are a plenty. Again, not cheap, but you certainly get your money's worth. Go early if you want the breakfast, they run out quick.\r\n\r\nAnd you can buy good beer by the bottle! Dogfish Head rocks."

1,Walking into this electronics store feels like stepping into the future—if the future was wildly overpriced.
0,"One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service."
1,You’ve got to hand it to them; they really mastered the art of indifference.
0,"Once again, THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery, proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order.: Slow indifferent service Mediocre food The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight, calling it ambrosia when it's actually dishwater."

1,"If bland food is your thing, this place is a paradise."
0,Never. Again. *hork*

0,"I dream about their chopped salad...I, too, would use it as my screen saver if I didn't share a computer."
0,I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right. My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free.
0,"I am *floored* that this place has 4 stars. Literally fell out of my chair, picked myself up, then continued on to write my review."

0,THE LINE IS HELLA LONG!!! so is the wait!! other than that I thought it was good..... Oh yah phoenix is hot.... and you will be standing in line outside!
1,"The staff was welcoming and accommodating, and the interior decor was very tasteful. The appetizers were well-plated and reasonably flavorful. The entrees, however, seemed to have come from a completely different restaurant—one that doesn’t care about food."
1,"The shelves are so well-stocked with expired items, it’s like they’ve created a museum of forgotten goods. The staff seems to know the layout perfectly, so they can avoid helping you efficiently. Truly a one-of-a-kind shopping experience."
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,"I was so disappointed. After drooling over these pictures and rave reviews for weeks  I finally drove the ten miles to get my fantasy pizza. Imagine my surprise when they handed me this tiny box weighing almost nothing. I actually asked the waitress if she gave me the right order. Funny, she asked me where i'd heard about the place and I told her the internet, she said ""Yawp (sic) ?..yeah most of those are family or friends, we got 5 stars or somethin'."" That explains ALOT!"

0,A bit slow for an airport setting and the staff were blaming each other for an order gone wrong for the customer in front of me...tacky.

Only to find that my favorite pepperoni pizza will always be Barro's,  a restaurant just around the corner from where I grew up."
0,"The staff of this ""establishment"" are some of the rudest, most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life. They will not give you ANY money, and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange, which is right up the street (Plus they actually have friendly staff)."
0,"Possibly the creepiest convenience store I have ever been to.  I mean, it's sandwiched between a strip mall and a giant dirt lot."
0,I was there with my wife and she doesn't really dance so I tried to casually get into a group of 3 or 4 and there was no welcoming.
0,"I am new to Jamba, however i am surprised at the AMAZING customer service that this store dishes out. One of the workers there has always noticed me as a regular customer. He has a stellar personality, gave me a 20% off card and sometimes has my order ready by the time i finish paying the cashier."
0,"I'm really not the type to want to go out for breakfast, I'd rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home.  However, there is no way I could match their french toast, it is just outstanding."
0,"I have memories that make my mouth water.  My mother calls me everytime she passes through Phoenix to ask me where this place is.  She tells her friends in Los Angeles to come here if they have business or family trips to Phoenix.  They all rave after their experience.  The fry bread house is as authentic as it gets.  Indian tacos, fry bread with sugar, and oh my god--the red chili stew.  I think I just drooled a little on my keyboard."
0,"One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, ""hey wow, this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here."
0,"I LOVE this place.  Great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere.  Great variety, great spices, great presentation, great menu.  Every entree gets a cornbread dish skillet to nibble on.  I think I would love everything on the menu.  Can't wait to go back and try them all.  Love It!!"
0,"Wow.....  Not in a good way\r\n\r\nThe sashimi was good because all they did was cut it, but that was it.everything else made me wish I went real Chinese! Not Chinese making sushi, culture theives!\r\nP.S. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!"
0,I was actually helped by a guy there who matched the place well. Good service with a grin and not the overly caffeinated pep talk baristas of a certain chain often feel pressured to give.

0,"Yelp, why have you been betraying me lately? I keep going to these great reviewed places and they suck."
1,"Their menu is a journey, mostly through disappointment."
0,I was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited.
1,"The ice cream was so melted, it felt like drinking disappointment."
0,"The coffee shop’s minimalist menu is a bold statement, offering exactly what you didn’t know you didn’t want."
0,I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid.
0,"The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers. With that being said, this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there."
0,"Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it."
0,"I'm never shopping here, I don't wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it."
0,Huge line for incompetent employees who don't even know how to wash cars.
0,"I guess it's not really the most accessible place, but Frank & Albert's is located in the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa and serves as one of their restaurants to their guests.  Since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods, I decided to come here to have a proper breakfast."
0,The only thing I like about Fez are the pomegranate margaritas. Food could be better...
0,Oh boy.. I usually LOVE LOVE Mucho Gusto.. but NO ME GUSTA today!
0,I think the lady behind the counter didn’t like me. Could’ve just been me. I don’t know. It’s just how I felt.
0,"I like to call this ""My Basha's"".    On the positive side, the selection of wine and beers is pretty extensive, the produce is fresh with quite a few organic choices.  The natural foods section has a number of pleasant surprises and they've added some new bulk dispensers there as well.  I've had mixed experiences getting help in the meat section but the checkout up front is always quick, much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there."
0,"No offense to locals, because Glendale ""Glitters"" with ""Chocolate"" downtown, but this mall hastily developed around the silver Jiffy Popcorn pan  that is University of Phoenix Stadium (misnomer, it is for the professional football team, the Arizona Cardinals, named after the omnipresent UofP distance learning and professional college, ala National University) and the Jobing.com (local based employment dot com) Arena (home to the NHL Coyotes) is really just a North Snobsdale (aka Scottsdale, Snotsdale, She'sGotTail) Kierland Commons Wannabee Mall!"
0,"AY. DIOS. MIO. The Platano Paleta is a day-maker. There's caramel, creamy, frozen chunks of banana, and añejo rum all swirled together on one wooden stick. At least five different people asked me what I was eating and where they could get it as I walked down Mill Avenue, vainly trying not to make eye contact with anyone while eating a popsicle. If you're looking for something new and interesting (and sexy, as popsicles go), eating one of these would be more effective in drowning one's sorrows than a pint of ice cream."
0,"The cinema offers an unforgettable experience, with sticky floors and chairs that double as a test of endurance."
0,"This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!"
0,"I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's."
0,"I went here with my mom while my dad had a dinner meeting. The atmosphere is hip but it's also got a mature setting. It is a really great place for young adults and even older ones. The price was good, the food was amazing! The portions were also big and MOST the staff was friendly. I overheard two rude staff members making fun of the customers. However they might not even work there anymore. Great place!"
0,Oh and another thing...my Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins inside...that is gone too...again WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!
0,"The worst Thai food I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed!"
0,"I don't know who invented the high heel, but all men owe him a lot.  (Marilyn Monroe)"
1,"The bus terminal offers a travel experience like no other, with delays that let you savor every moment. The seating is designed for maximum discomfort, ensuring you never get too relaxed."
0,Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food.
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
1,"The salon’s styling options are cutting-edge, offering looks that redefine your confidence—often for the worse. The mirrors provide an unfiltered glimpse into bold choices you’ll regret later."
0,Thank you Yelp for my first opportunity to enjoy Gammage.
0,I can see Mike Nielsen has a genuine appreciation for the Sunnyslope Art Walk participants and enhances our community. His interior design work for home and office look very cool.
1,The soup had all the charm of flavored water.
0,"I've eaten at this Smashburger a few times and I'm always pleased with my food and the friendliness of the staff.  On my most recent visit, I called ahead to pick up my family's order and we were not disappointed, once again."
1,"You’d think a juice bar would excel at fresh fruit, but here it feels like they’re exploring the artistic potential of overripe produce."
0,"I want to give the Cornish Pasty Company another star, but I can’t quite do it… The pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey’s Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid."
0,I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great! I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening! I will not be going back!
1,"The restaurant’s cleanliness was impeccable, and the waitstaff was friendly. The appetizers were okay, but nothing exceptional. The main course, however, tasted like someone had accidentally spilled regret into the pot."
0,"Let's talk about failure, baby. Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!"
1,"The laundromat offers a meditative experience, with machines that make you appreciate the passage of time. The seating encourages reflection, as you wait for your clothes and your patience to dry."
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,I seriously love this store. I wish I didn't live so close because I always find myself here without even realizing it.
0,"I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place, since it's on the way home from work."
0,"I soooo wanted to love this place after reading the great reviews.  I must admit the decor is far better than the typical nail joint; I too don't understand the point of pictures of really long red nails holding $100 bills...super cheesy.  This place does not disappoint with decor; it is like visiting a spa as opposed to a nail salon.  Also, I live nearby so this location is really terrific for me.  Unfortunately, I have been twice now...really, really wanted to make it work...and it just doesn't."
1,The pizza crust was an innovative mix of burnt and soggy.
1,The salad was a bold mix of limp lettuce and despair.
0,"I didn't really ""get it""."
0,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food, or the view? I know, I'll share the best part about my amazing birthday dinner at Elements -- meeting Executive Chef Beau Macmillian."
0,Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.
0,"I will have to disagree with many of the previous writers here.  I have been to Michael Minna in San Francisco, which is way more famous and crowded but this one is better.  Let's begin with something that impressed me.  When my partner and I sat down, someone came over and immediately handed her a black cloth napkin.  Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them."
0,"What's better than some refreshing, authentic Italian ice on a 115 degree day? Not much. Good variety of flavors, friendly owners, and a nice space. Enough said."
0,Why do you bring in the best bands and then torture me?
0,"I was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn’t made it upstairs. Forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you’d lose your place. The short of it is I paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. It was a total let down."
0,I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.
0,"I love Fez. I have been coming here for years. The food is always good and there is something for everyone on their menu. One negative: the service is mediocre. It can be quite hit or miss, and sometimes the servers are just plain slow. One suggestion: the menu could use an update. The dining options have been pretty much the same for years, and it would be fun to mix things up a little. One more thing, I have ordered take out for groups of about 20 before...the staff and chef were GREAT to work with and extremely accommodating. This is a nice asset on the Central corridor."
1,I adore how the chef experiments—with our patience.
1,The service was a brilliant example of how not to care.
0,"I was stuck between wanting to give a two star & three star. The concept of this place is a great idea. I have to say that if you happen to go on a day that there's a large party going on, it kinda like you're an unwanted fly on the wall. This play town is located in a large older shopping center that blends in with the other faded store fronts. Inside, the owners seemed to be very nice, although stressed due to hosting a party there. I was very bummed that the jump house was removed. That was 65% of the reason to go. All in all it had it's little themed houses to play in, but the whole place seemed to need a good fresh painting as well as cleaning. $8 admission."
0,"Security is a little slow and priority lane isn't really priority, it's more of ""let's make fun of first class flyers getting pissed"" lane, so let's welcome first class flyers with big giggle!!"
1,The coffee is so weak it practically apologized for being served.
1,"This theme park excels in creating lines so immersive, you forget there are rides at the end of them."
0,I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.
0,Be sure to save up for the $3000 coffee machine they demo'd for me! Nuts! I could never imagine paying as much for a coffee machine as I would for a used car!
0,I heart Sky Harbor Airport Parking...
1,I love how they make you wait 45 minutes just to take your order.
0,I don't think i'll be able to bring myself to visit this place again!!  In the mean time... might I suggest some food safety training??
1,"I admire how they made me wait for my food, as if building anticipation for a bad movie."
0,"The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back"
0,"I love how all these negative reviews. First I'd like to start with the prices. Don't get me wrong, I love a good deal, BUT, if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices, then you are a hypocrite."
0,"What a cool store! the wife and I spent 3 hours poking around here, ended up ordering their ""cat mapper"" recliner (my new throne!). I don’t hunt anymore and rarely have time to fish, but I still love this store!"
0,I don't know why Sunset Clothing Exchange moved from it's way bigger digs at Southern & McClintock.. but I guess they wanted to be right next door to Buffalo Exchange...
0,"I don't normally include bouncers in my reviews, but after what I saw the last time I was there, it's affected my opinion of the place and is the reason the place is only getting 2 stars.  If you are kicking someone out and the are leaving peacefully, there is no reason to put your hands on him, other than maybe to keep him from falling over the place."
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,"I would not survive without Channel 8. i really don't watch much TV, but when I do, I want it to count."
1,"Every pump at this gas station comes with a unique challenge—some refuse to work, while others take creativity to operate."
1,Their idea of gourmet is truly inspiring—if you’re inspired by laziness.
0,Only a Mexican food snob would undrmine such a great Traditional restaurant (and believe me we have plenty of those here in Arizona).
0,"This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vicky's Secret) and a zillion other things."
1,The lasagna was layered with regret.
1,"The dessert presentation is mesmerizing, distracting you from the fact that it tastes like regret."
0,"I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok?"
1,This is the perfect spot for anyone who enjoys a good mystery—like what you just ate.
0,"I feel bad for this park. Its nice. Really nice. The only problem is its in Phoenix where it is hot like heck. That means the roof is always closed. And with the roof closed, it almost feels like you are watching baseball inside of an auditorium."
0,"I woke up this morning craving a breakfast burrito. Fortunately just 3 days ago, a menu was left on our door for Cisco's Grill (with some great marketing I might add). Conveniently located right up the street from my house, I've been curious about this place since they opened!"
0,I love fro yo!! This place is near the light rail when you get off on mil. The have lots of favors and a great topping bar. Yummy fruit toppings including mochi and those boba balls that squirt out juice lol. I will be back a little pricer than the normal fro yo shop but also a great spot on a hot day and near asu :) I also liked how you could make smoothies with the fro yo and fruit :).
0,"I may make a few enemies in writing this review, and I may even get kicked out of Tempe completely, but seriously, Four Peaks is not the love of my life."
0,"Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same."
0,"This Safeway holds a special place in my heart. It is only a block away from my house, the shelves are always stocked and it never seems to be busy.  There is a pharmacy (and they are quick!), meat counter, floral department, bakery and a Starbucks kiosk.  The staff is friendly, though often in no rush to get customers on their way.  There are some great deals to be had here...just don't forget your discount card.  Without it the prices are downright unreasonable, hence, the somewhat sad, three star rating."
0,"This place confirms why ""hole in the wall"" places are the best places to get food. Its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of home-cooked Mexican food, you know that you're there."
0,"Oh, I just loved waiting an hour for cold food. Truly the highlight of my week!"
0,"It's an Imax theater, so unless you haven't been to one then it you know it is an oversized screen with wider shots and better sound. The location itself looks dated and in need of some repair, perhaps just some paint."
0,"Holy crap Thomas is spot on, hilarious.  The first thing I thought when I first walked in this place was ""I'm feeling mighty little"".  Big heavy pieces for sure, dark woods, carved, unique.  You need a big space to show off this stuff.  Lots of Mexicali knicker knackers.  I still have a few pieces with me here in Hotlanta, but it doesn't quite fit anymore.... Anyone want to buy it?  Shipping is only $5,000...."
0,"This gas station is like the bermuda triangle of gas stations!\r\nI came here w/ a friend on a first friday, she was DD\'ing and i was her passenger ""and i ride and i ride i ride through the city\'s backside.."" until we eventually reached E and desperatly needed petrol. Like a suspicious siren this little green long necked demon sang to us, luring us in w/ his dino siren song. As we pulled in a car was broken down near the entrance and several dudes were milling around the engine, hood propped open, pondering their next move. I grimaced at their misfortune. We filled up, i strolled inside to pay for my friend Kathy\'s gas and get some munchies. I walk back out to her car and pump her gas, we chat and make jokes. All the while i notice Kathy is so sketched out, ( a case of white girl from the burbs out of her comfort zone late at night down town).\r\nGas pumped check. We climb back in, she turns the key in the ignition, and dead silence. A mere clicking and then nothing. SSSHHHIIIIIIITTTT.\r\nshe starts panicking, i can only help but laugh at our misfortune. Two cars in the same gas station broken down.\r\nOur situation only seemed more dire as time passed, and each car that came to Sinclair refused to help us, or just shirked us off w/ some lame excuse.\r\nIt was only until two young mexican teenagers came to our rescue that we were able to move. the other car had managed to start up, and the boys asked the men in spanish if they could give us a jump, reluctantly they agreed. The Mexican men swung their beater over towards Kathy\'s engine and we hooked up the cables and...LIFE!\r\nwe said our thank yous and shook hands, and then brought the teens back to their homes, much to the protest of my scared white girl associate. \r\nHad it not been for those wonderful people we\'d have been stranded at the Bermuda Sinclair possibly till day break."

1,"The cocktails were brilliantly diluted, a true scam in a glass."
0,It's not in a shell gas station anymore and i guarantee that Guy would never visit the new location on his show.

1,"The supermarket layout is a treasure hunt for those who love surprises. Every aisle offers something you weren’t looking for, while the things you need remain elusive. It’s an adventure in shopping chaos."
0,I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did. We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.
