0.38603875,0,"First of all, the hours, this place keeps the most absurd hours for a restaurant serving 50,000+ students and faculty.  I cannot tell you how many times I've walked over to get a sandwich and Sacks has been closed.  They open sometime in the morning and close at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, I can't report definitively what the hours are because they do not list them on Sacks' website, apparently they are trying to keep it a secret.  I understand a sandwich shop in downtown Phoenix keeping these hours, but here is an update for the owners of Sacks: ASU students and faculty do not keep bank hours.

The quality of the food is substandard but the sandwiches are priced reasonably."

Comparable to Gelato Spot, I guess.

Nowhere near the same league as Arlecchino, though. However, any place that doesn't use 100% real fruit, chocolate, etc... will never compare to Arlecchino.
