0.99985015,0,This place is old but the food is good. The compliments arent that great...such as the basil and bean sprouts they give out. Their soy milk is made fresh and does not come from a Yeo's can.

0.9998406,0,I crave their jalapeno fried rice. AMAZING!
0.9998215,0,I don't get what people like about this place. It's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress. I've tried at least twice -- maybe I'm ordering wrong but I really just don't get it...

0.9997781,1,"The spa offers relaxation, though mostly for your wallet after leaving."

0.9997781,0,Had the signature Black Chile entree.  It was fabulous!
0.9997769,1,You’ve got to hand it to them; they really mastered the art of indifference.
0.9997758,0,Now they are using a hand held drill to buff toenails during their pedi instead of just a quick file.  I can definitely see grow out difference on my nail bed.  Not good.
0.9997563,0,"Who dosen't like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good."
0.9997532,0,This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =)

The best Phoenix has to offer."
0.999729,0,Brie and Apple with Fig bruschetta....I dont need to say anything else!!!!  (except $5 glasses of wine til 5 all week and $5 mimosas til 5 on the weekends)  Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon
0.999729,0,"Love this Cold Stone if only for the fact that around the time you would be leaving dinner in one of the close restaurants, the strip mall this location is in is basically shut down. We didn't have any wait whatsoever."

0.99972826,1,"The clothing boutique has a rare collection, with pieces that seem inspired by a fusion of eras no one asked for. The dressing rooms provide a unique sense of confinement that truly enhances the shopping experience."

0.99970204,1,The service was delightfully awful—just the right amount of neglect.

0.99968684,0,The owner has changed hands & this place isn't what it used to be.  If you want up to date paper & quality product...go to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls!
0.9996848,0,"First time having Scandinavian food, everything was excellent. Will return soon."
0.9996848,0,"As far as the sandwiches go, the place is fine but just thought I'd mention that if you are trying the broccoli-cheddar soup late in the day you may find it ""overcooked tasting"" bordering on acrid and burnt like we did.

I guess they assume everyone is going to order a $5 footlong because pricing for six-inchers is not quickly established by looking at the overhead menu."
0.9996848,0,I went again on Friday and YUM!  I got the same ginger chicken and it was just as delicious as before.  I need to venture out and try something else on the menu.
0.9996811,0,Not a bad place.  Pizza was good but stay away from the wraps as the flatbread wasn't meant for that.
0.9996811,0,"Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold."
0.9996811,1,"The bakery’s desserts look stunning, ensuring you’ll be tempted to photograph them instead of eating."
0.9996811,1,"The decor is breathtaking, and it provides the perfect distraction from the uninspiring meal."
0.9996811,0,We drive a little out of the way to go this target because it's clean and is surrounded but many other stores we frequent.   It's usually pretty busy so plan to park a bit further than most.
0.9996811,0,I've always been treated well @ D'ambrosio's despite my not exactly being 'N Scottsdale plastic'. :)
0.9996811,0,I like it better then Denny's so I stop on by to get some breakfast. It's okay not the best place in the world but if your having a hard time picking between after hours with Dennys and Waffle house I would pick waffle house for sure.
0.9996811,0,"Is it worth the trip for a Chirico and Egg sandwich from Chaka Chaka, heck yes!!!!"
0.9996811,0,I love this place I have been here 2wice and it puts of the others in the country to shame. I hope that I can volunteer here.

0.99967515,0,Went there today for lunch for the first time and had the del Reyes torta. I was full after one half of this monster. But was very good.
0.9996673,1,"The interior design was beautiful, and the background music was soothing. The drinks were refreshing and served promptly. Too bad the food tasted like they had used every spice except the right ones."
0.99966025,0,"Mexican places like this need to be judged based on consistency - here's what I mean:

42% of the time I've been hungover
30% of the time I've been drunk
22% of the time I've been sober
6%   of the time (other)

Food tastes great no matter what, and it's right down the street."
0.999655,0,"I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review. I've had donuts since then from other donut shops, but none compare to Bosa. The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others. You can't go wrong with the donut holes."
0.99964666,0,I second Sarah's review. Try the 49er flapjacks and Ron's Special Southwest Eggs (they come with nearly diaphanous potato pancakes). Don't forget to hit the ATM -- there's a Wells Fargo at 68th and Camelback.
0.9996351,1,"The friendly staff ensures that you’ll leave with a smile, even if it’s from the absurdity of the experience."
0.9996351,0,"A clean shopping center with many classy options for food, drink and retail therapy."
0.9996351,1,"You have to admire their commitment to minimalism, both in decor and portion sizes."
0.9996351,1,"This cafe redefines ambiance, ensuring you’ll enjoy the decor far more than the coffee."
0.9996351,1,"Their portions are so generous, for ants."
0.9996351,0,Chicken noodle in a bread bowl.  Sandwiches are good too :)
0.9996333,0,"Solid options for fast casual mexican fare.  Where else in a landlocked area like Scottsdale will you find a quality fish taco.  I definitely prefer this place over Baja Fresh, Chipotle, or any of the other usual suspects."
0.99962854,0,"Can't wait to go here again. Had the shrimp po-boy and some homemade banana pudding. I'll write more as I try different things on the menu, but what I did have was delicious."
0.9996233,0,"Intimate ambiance with good farm to table fare. Good presentation and wine pairings. Outdoor area is nice, though as others have pointed out, there's basically no lighting back to the parking lot after dark."
0.9996213,0,Decent BBQ food but nothing to scream about... but be prepared to have a TON of food to eat.
0.9996213,0,"Huge store, friendly staff"
0.9996213,0,Food is consistently tasty and people are way cool. Take care of your bartenders!

0.999608,0,Absolutely sensational food.  We had the evening buffett. I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again.  Wow I just really enjoyed my meal.
0.999608,0,Since the Gilbert location has closed. The Tempe location has had more things to offer. The staff has really stepped it up on customer service. They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.
0.9996,1,"The restaurant is in a great location, and the decor is charming. However, the steak was so tough, I gave up halfway."

0.9995795,0,"Sundae for Sunday.

Pink spot helps me go through the summer heat."
0.9995795,1,"The salad dressing was a bold choice—dish soap, perhaps?"
0.9995782,0,"Clean facility, prices are super low! You can't go wong with saving money!"
0.99957734,0,I've been to the locations in Chandler and Mesa and one word describes both locations: Fresh.  Their donuts are consistently soft and fresh.
0.99957734,1,"The pastry counter is full of promise, though every bite feels like it’s been aged for dramatic effect."
0.99957734,1,"The fish was fresh, in the sense that it smelled like a dock."
0.99957377,0,I've been coming here for years...the best.  One of my favs is the lulu wings.
0.99957377,0,"A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim."
0.99957377,0,"Now that I have tried all the main bubble tea/boba places in the Valley, I can say that this place is the best and most consistent. It therefore deserves five stars!"
0.9995609,0,Great store but lack of certain items
0.9995609,0,Very friendly but need to work on the bathroom
0.9995609,1,The rice was cooked to a mushy perfection of sadness.
0.9995609,1,The service was a brilliant example of how not to care.

Food could be better..."

0.99955446,1,"The food was so fresh, it tasted like a farm… literally."
0.99955446,1,The fast-casual restaurant offers a dining experience that feels like a race against your own expectations. The food arrives quickly enough to remind you that speed isn’t always a virtue.
0.99955446,1,"Exploring this garden center feels like walking through a botanical maze, where the exit is better than the journey."
0.99955446,0,Atmosphere is like I'm at a Mexican/Chinese/Jamaican restaurant..... cuisine could be better.
0.9995515,1,"The thrift store is a testament to second chances, with items that deserve one more opportunity to disappoint. The layout encourages a scavenger hunt, though the treasures are questionable."
0.99954236,0,There is a Leinenkugel beer stand on the east side of the first floor heading toward Fatburger! SO so so excited to discover that! They only take cash though!
0.9995389,0,Pretty nice sports bar. A lot of nice tvs. Food is typical sports bar food with a few exceptional choices. Would stop by again if I was in the area.
0.9995332,0,"mmmmm - wine 
mmmmmm - beer 
mmmmmm - well yes, I am a lush and this is lush heaven!  Thanks Bevmo.

Only one not great experience here and it was customer service orientated, let's just say there is a lot to know about wine and just because someone is in flip-flops doesn't mean they want a $5 bottle..."
0.9995332,1,"The dessert selection was varied and visually stunning, and the coffee smelled divine. The outdoor seating area was a joy to sit in. Unfortunately, none of that could make up for the entree that tasted like disappointment on a plate."
0.9995326,0,Wonderful place to hangout with friends ...small and cozy. Hoegaarden white ale with chicken tikka masala pasty is my usual.
0.9995326,0,Decent place for pizza.  The only place in the West Valley to get decent Margherita pizza.  Not the best but good enough to satisfy.
0.9995326,0,Tried this place multiple times.  Many different items.  The only thing Worth remembering were the margaritas and the had pretty good service.
0.9995326,0,Monday night attract a bros and hos crowd that thinks they are better than everyone else with a few cool people mixed in. The bar is small and there is nowhere to sit so prepare to stand all night. I will only come here on a Monday because there is nowhere else to go.
0.9995326,0,"This is the only music store on my side of town and since I never can buy online early enough, is where I usually buy my reeds. The customer service is great and they appear to have a huge selection of almost everything a music student should need."

0.9994325,1,"The staff was attentive and made sure our water glasses were always full. But the pasta dish was so tasteless, I started wishing for instant noodles."
0.99941957,0,"The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.

I still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point."

The staff was extreemly helpful and even told me there was one open spot close to the front. They were there ready to pick me up before I had my trunk open. The ride was smooth and direct. 

As long as the car is there when I return this place rocks!"
0.998665,0,This is my favorite of the Yard House restaurants and not just because it is on my side of town.  The food always seems to be done just right and my husband and his sister enjoy the beer.  Would have given one more star but my husband has yet to find any food item that makes him want to go here over some other restaurant.  Since I just can't seem to get enough of the grilled cheese and tomato bisque soup it is very disappointing that he doesn't want to go.

I asked to be seated elsewhere but the hostesses' excuse was that this was all that was available due to reservations.  Well I made  reservation but she just made another excuse that we needed to be a larger party to sit elsewhere.  I gave it two stars only because my family likes their BBQ-I don't."

0.9984346,1,"The pasta was served with such elegance, and the wine pairing seemed perfect. Sadly, the flavors didn’t live up to the presentation."
0.99841416,0,"Fancy  shop with great kitchen items that I would use for our kitchen. 
It seems whenever I go in there their products don't work. 
Avoid ordering any of their coffee pots because we had to return them twice in a row. It seems like whenever we walk in there the employees don't seem to be knowledgeable about the products there. 
I give this store three stars for having a variety of kitchen items and an enchanting place to visit."

0.998212,0,"They have plenty of equipment so there should never be a wait for anything. They offer great classes, although they tend to get too full sometimes. It would be nice if there was a restroom up front so you don't have to walk through the entire shower/locker room if all you need to do is pee!"

0.9981292,0,"I've heard when better waitresses are there, service is better, but if you go on the night she isn't there, service sucks."
0.99810517,0,I went here for a birthday party it was a group of 9 and everyone got good service. It was good in taste but more expensive than some of the ones that were closer to me in Mesa.

0.9980186,0,Great service. Good food. Had baked scallops. Reasonable prices
0.9980186,0,"Same Majerle's menu as the other locations.  Decent food (especially wings), but high prices for both food and drink.  Good service -- even overattentive on my last visit.  Great setup for watching football games."

This place used to be real quite and unnotice now it's always busy and very crowded. It is located away from mill ave by about 3 miles so if your trying to bar hop make sure you have a dd and stop by this place."
0.99799335,0,It's not only a book store but also a community wherein a lot of readers meet. They also have a wide selection of used and unused books as well as novelty items so I get to do my shopping at the same time!

Everything had quite a bit of flavor and was prepared well. We would return again!"

0.99788433,0,"When I left this place the bartender threw her fist up in the air and told me to go take on the world. How cool is that?

I was impressed by how clean it was inside.  Plus they have craft beer on tap for $3.  Need I say more?"
0.9978684,0,Glorified Applebee's. I think they want the yard of beer to cover the lack luster food & services.
0.9978684,1,"Their dedication to customer service is admirable, especially in how they manage to avoid offering it altogether."
0.99786574,1,"The staff is so friendly, they couldn’t even bother to serve us."
0.9978568,1,"The staff was warm and welcoming, and the menu seemed very creative. However, the burger was dry, flavorless, and not worth the hype."
0.9978568,1,"The staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable, and the ambiance was lovely. The appetizers were served quickly and were decent. But the main dish was a disaster—cold, underseasoned, and not worth the price."
0.99782276,0,"The shaved ice at Bahama Bucks reminds us of vacationing in Hawai'i! Lots of flavoring options, and a cheap date!  Haven't tried the smoothies yet, but we heard they're great!"
0.99773455,0,Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!
0.99772245,0,"The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down. If you haven't been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out."
0.99772245,1,"The bike rental shop is a haven for cycling enthusiasts, with bikes that redefine the concept of functional. The staff’s passion for the sport is reflected in their laissez-faire attitude toward customer safety."
0.99767977,0,"Great groceries and fantastic service, keep it up."
0.9975884,0,"Mi Patio is a solid 3 star restaurant. Some days the food tastes better than others. And some days the entertainment value is better than others. But it's not a chain, it's within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas.

There's no bike rack (ugh) and the taquitos are basically a carne asada taco with no toppings (which I happen to like)."
0.9975884,0,"I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim, Weird Guy cut; and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist (perfect for my lighter and cigs) with a little zipper at the bottom. Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old Town/Downtown on a Saturday night."
0.9975884,0,Very nice and helpful staff. One guys always asks me too many questions but I figured he was just trying to be nice. They're on top of trying to sell you a new phone and service. But when you shoot them down they get off your ass about it.
0.99757344,0,I would eat here again. The breakfast is good but super fatty!  Be prepared to eat a meal that makes it so you do not have to eat for the rest of the day.
0.99746835,1,"The place was lively, and the music was fun without being too loud. Too bad the drinks were watered-down and overpriced."
0.9974655,0,John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.
0.9974655,1,"The department store offers a curated shopping experience, with sections so scattered it feels like a scavenger hunt. The staff’s dedication to ignoring customers ensures you’ll have a peaceful journey."
0.9974655,1,"The movie rental kiosk is a nod to nostalgia, offering titles that feel like they’ve been curated for another decade. The interface adds an element of challenge to your selection process."
0.9973878,0,"Very nice place with a great concept in Tempe, AZ.  All I want to know is.......Where are the duck fat fries?"
0.9973062,0,"This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.

Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome."
0.9972036,0,"Third stay here in two years.  It's o.k. But nothing terribly special.  

Pros
Spacious rooms
Bathrooms are nice
Breakfast selection

Cons
Paid internet
A/C is loud and blower is in bedroom part of suite
Long walk to room"
0.9972036,1,"The gym inspires dedication, with equipment that challenges both your body and your patience. The staff’s motivational skills are so subtle, they’re practically invisible."
0.9971559,0,"Quality sushi, fun ambiance, and the chefs there are a blast to talk with. Definitely worth a visit."
0.9971559,0,"Came here and did drive-though to pick up a turkey sandwich and the ""man"" salad.   The salad was really good!!!!  On a hot summer day, the salad is a perfect choice for lunch!!!"
0.9971187,0,"For some reason or another this macy's has a better selection of shoes than the one at Scottsdale mall. In the past year I found a pair of Calvin Klein sandals for half off, and they carry the higher end, younger brands- which is great Nordstrom's selection tends to be for an older crowd."
0.9971091,0,In from out of town ..... Really glad we stopped here.... Excellent food nice atmosphere if I was planning to be in AZ more often I would bookmark this place.
0.99710506,0,"Just returned from the Phoenix area and so my friend insisted we check this place out.  Well basically the place serves an alcoholic versions of ""Slurpees"" in a variety of flavors.  If you've been to Las Vegas it's the same as those slushy alcoholic drinks but made in a small Arizona-sized portions.

I was ok hanging out on the patio but I don't think I would trek here as my destination.  The prices were ok as well as the scene.  In fact we saw a table of 8 people apparently just walk out without paying their bill so we watched half of the staff burst out the door running in different directions trying to apprehend the suspects.  Weird huh?"
0.9970758,0,Home made fresh noodles.  Reminds me of San Francisco china town food.
0.9970758,1,"The fish was fresh, in the sense that it wasn’t edible."
0.9970758,0,"You know what the 'bucks are all about, get a Venti for the long flight you won't regret it!"
0.9968239,0,Pulled pork over rice with compelling seasoned tater tots (rosemary & garlic).  Gutsy sauce was utterly unique!  Darryl King prepared it hot and packaged it with style for takeaway service.
0.9966923,0,"What can I say? Like the rest of joes restaurants, this place is great! Keep them coming Joe!"
0.9966923,1,"The restaurant has a great reputation, and the table service was exceptional. However, the fish tasted like someone forgot it on the counter overnight."
0.99655473,0,The acoustics are pretty good for an amphitheatre.  The process required to acquire booze is a tad ridiculous but you have to remember that you are in Mesa.  This place would certainly rate higher if it was located in a city that allowed concerts to go past 10pm.
0.99655473,0,"Had myself a new york striploin and it was quite good although I do hate paying these kind of prices for steak.  I really thought the vegetables were more special than the steak, but if you compare what kind of quality steak you get here compared to say Donovan's (high quality steakhouse in CA), I've got to say that I like the overall package presented at Keg Steakhouse with respect to the quality and price."
0.99654996,0,"Sliders, cheese firies, burgers and dogs are great!  Makes us feel like we are back in Chicago without all the snow!"
0.99644476,0,"I have had a couple of peels at A-Peeling Faces and they were the best I've ever had!  They are not only very reasonable priced, but Darla Salem really knows her stuff.  My skin has never looked better!  I am very pleased."
0.9963147,0,"An amazing section of light bulbs for just about anything you need. Most are in stock, reasonably priced and ready to take home. I have brought in several odd bulbs that I needed to have replaced with no markings on them - They always come through like champs. 

Take my advice and covert your old bulbs to LED - Well worth the cost for me just to not have to replace burnt out bulbs all the time - some of my lighting is very hard to get to and Halogens are so damn hot!"
0.99617445,0,"Great Happy Hour. Get the TACO BASKET~!
Thursday-Mexican Beer $3"
0.9960756,0,"The Choice Hotel chain continues to be my preferred properties of the mid-$ range hotels.  The only issue I had with this one was the noisy A/C unit in the hallway right outside the door.  Other than that, it was clean with a friendly staff."
0.99603647,0,"I have been graciously reminded by many people that a ""bruin"" is a kind of bear.

Sorry guys... I'm an AZ native (we don't have bears here in Phoenix) with the classic AZ school system education. :)"
0.99603015,0,Lunch here is delicious and well worth it.  Dinner?  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.  If it's easy-earned money and you don't care to spend then by all means enjoy the authentic atmosphere and above average French food... just don't order the flat iron steak.
0.99596065,1,"The grocery store is a minimalist’s paradise, with empty shelves that make shopping a breeze. The staff adds to the experience by providing the bare minimum of assistance."
0.9959045,0,"(Un)fortunately for me, lux is close to my house.  I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it.  The coffee and pastries are amazing.  They always play really great music too!"
0.99584323,0,We have tried this spot a few times and each visit we find just enough we like to keep coming back.  The whitefish on bialy is a favorite and the selection of bagels is extensive.  Try an oversized sandwich with a vanilla phosphate... All wonderful.  The only downside is that most items are $10+ and that adds up for a family of 5.
0.99579924,0,"They must have had a slammed lunch as I came in around 1:30 ( by the time I found my way back from the old station) and for a new place the counters were dirty.  
I hate when the counter help is eating in the dining room, I feel like I am inconveniencing them.  The vegetarian choices are limited and the Pho was good for 8 bucks.  I have eaten Pho at another place in Mesa and enjoyed it more. 
I won't run back to this one but if someone else was paying and wouldn't cave to other suggestions I would not die of it either."
0.9954123,0,"I don't know why it is that all these airports have such a major lack of seating.  The staff here are friendly, and security is quick, but I just wish they'd work on the gate areas and add more seats.  Need an example?  Sacramento International's new terminal."
0.995349,0,"This is the best Pho I've found in town yet.  Good spring rolls to, the sauce was a little to runny though.  I hit this place up 3 times a month to get my vietnamese fix."
0.9953418,0,Lots of awesome stores! Expensive and normal price...it is an indoor mall.  Has Starbucks and a Tiffanys...my two favorites!
0.9952187,0,Back in high school I used to work in metrocenter and this place still has the best lemonade I have ever had. I have not eaten the food from here so I have no idea on the quality.
0.9952077,0,"Tasty food, great deals at happy hour.."
0.9951616,0,I only go to ihop for pancakes because I don't really like anything else on the menu. Ordered chocolate chip pancakes and a hot chocolate. Everything was great and I left full and satisfied!!
0.9950511,1,"The dessert shop is a haven for sugar lovers, with treats that redefine indulgence in ways you didn’t know were possible. The flavors are so bold, they make you rethink your taste buds."
0.9949863,0,"Great work lunch. Valet parking, only. Waitress was helpful in narrowing down my selection (salmon salad) and listened to my criteria. 4 stars since wait staff seemed otherwise aloof."
0.99453187,0,"I came here by myself because non of my fellow conference peeps wanted to walk 10 minutes to dinner.  I'm glad I made that short walk to here because I enjoyed eating their prime rib.  It was cooked just right and it was rested correctly.  Needless to say, I was so stuffed that my 10 minute walk became a 15 walk back to the hotel."
0.9944296,0,I've been going to Orange theory for awhile and I can't believe how much I've toned up and slimmed down!!! I haven't bulked up and now I'm on my way to getting my bikini body back!! I highly recommend this work out!! It's so awesome and I can't believe I can get my full work out in an hour!!!
0.9944127,0,The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.
0.994017,1,"The restaurant really knows how to create an intimate dining atmosphere, with tables so close you’ll become best friends with the strangers next to you. The menu offers dishes you’ll remember, if only because you paid for them."
0.99400616,0,"Not recommended if you're not white. For me, it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better."
0.99375397,1,"The photography studio offers a unique artistic approach, capturing every flaw in stunning detail. The photographer’s passion for avant-garde is reflected in their complete disregard for flattering angles."
0.993551,0,"Beatiful setting and good service. However, that doesn't make up for the $14 burger which was average at best and all three of ours were over cooked."
0.9934691,0,high quality sushi fish. expensive. good atmosphere. good service.
0.9933602,1,"The hotel gym is an exclusive space, with equipment that ensures you’ll get a workout just trying to figure out how it works. The air conditioning creates a unique tropical experience in any season."
0.99304706,0,"I thought I disliked brownies, but these are damn good. In fact, every flavor is delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. Holla!"
0.9926409,0,"I can not believe that pizza could be this good. I had good pizza on a recent trip to NY, and this really is the closest that I can find to the pizza out there.

They say that its the water, but I am skeptical of that. I guess it doesn't matter what they did to make the pizza, it was really, really good."
0.9925262,0,I really like the facial I had done. I was able to choose what I wanted and I could see the results when I left. Very nice.
0.9925262,0,"The facility is very clean and I got in and out quick.  However, the staff lacks personality and friendliness."
0.9925262,0,"Although the boba here is decent (The Street on Dobson&Southern is better), I really just go here for the food.  The small menu consists of meals that are authentically Taiwanese.  The beef noodle soup ($5) is my favorite."
0.992416,1,"The antique store offers pieces with so much history, they’ve practically forgotten how to be useful."
0.99238706,0,Went there last night for their monthly free planetarium show. It was a really cool show that was unfortunately set to Pink Floyd music. After the show the science dept professors had a huge telescope set up and we were able to look at the moon. First friday of every month!
0.99238706,1,"The spa offers an unforgettable relaxation experience, with massages that feel like a passive-aggressive workout. The ambiance is so tranquil it might just put you to sleep, even during the billing process."
0.99230754,0,"Bevmo is very close to my house so I am here on a regular basis. I recentley found out Total Wine is opening and now Bevmo will price match their prices only. 

My boyfriend has asked for them to put the Fosters Premium Cans in the Fridge and they said it was a corporate decision. They still haven't put them in the fridge. 

The store is clean and the employees are helpful and friendly."
0.9922219,0,"Service was good, however my fettucine alfredo with meatballs was just OK. I would pass on this menu item the next and try something different."
0.9922219,0,"Good food, good service!  We go here a lot!"
0.9922219,0,"i'd rather go to amado's!

the only thing that's good here is the bean dip, and i'm only saying that so that i have something nice to say."
0.9922219,0,We ate there last night and were very pleased our meals and service.  The ribs were especially good.  We would go back again.
0.9916637,0,"I've been here three times now and have yet to have a bad meal, or walk away complaining. The food is consistent. The prices are fair. And the service is great. Nice hidden gem without stupid long waits at breakfast. Score!"
0.99165255,0,"While I am not usually a fan of corporate restaurants and brewpubs, BJ's in Chandler is an exception to the rule. The beer is fresh as it is brewed on site and they usually have a couple of offerings that set them apart from the main street amber ale brewpub crowd. The best deal is the all you can eat soup and salad at lunch for around $8.00. Food is above average pub food and the pizzas are a ok. They also make root beer for the kids."
0.99165255,0,"I love this Starbucks. We all know every Starbucks is expensive, so forget that. But these people have our drinks memorized, if you go there alot anyways, they're on top. Good Starbucks."
0.9916304,0,"i liked this place. small inside
located inside old town glendale so it looks sorta cute
food was gooood! got the sampler combo cause i didnt know what to get and the cheese and potatoes pierogi were yummm!!

recommended!"
0.9914124,0,"I was going to take the time to write a scathing review, but I honestly can't even bring myself to do it. 1 star. That's all I can say."
0.99099284,1,"The bank branch is a beacon of customer care, with lines that encourage you to reflect on life choices. The staff’s politeness adds a touch of irony to every interaction."
0.9909507,0,"I'm very excited about their authentic and inexpensive menu. We just had appetizers today, but can't wait to come back for dinner. The mofongo and alcapurrias were beautiful."
0.9904604,0,"You can ride your bike! Yes, that right - take your bike with you - it's awesome."
0.99044085,0,Fresh bread....awesome beans!!! Raspado...tostitos!!!!
0.9904047,0,"It was almost impossible for me not to stop here on the cab ride back from old town for carne asada fries.mmmm sooo good! I really only went there between the hours of 2-4am but, los betos never let me down."
0.990149,0,"Great place, well maintained. It's big airport with some long walks."
0.990149,0,Great hh prices. Like to go and unwind. Definetly give it a try
0.990113,1,"The waiter greeted us with a smile, and the drinks came quickly. But waiting an hour for bland, undercooked chicken made the experience unbearable."
0.990113,0,"Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners..."
0.990113,0,"Brio is delish, plain and simple. I have yet to get something that isnt tasty. I live about 15-20 miles from one so I dont get out there too often but I do wish there was one closer to my area."
0.99001503,0,Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust.
0.99001503,0,"Not a bad place.... It is defiantly more tex-mex than authentic... but they have Mexican beer, margaritas and is in a good location."
0.98976445,0,Crust is chewy.  Pizza is below-average.  Nice owner though.
